# WGU-C867-Project
C867 - Scripting and Programming Applications: Scripting and Programming - Applications for undergraduates explores the various aspects of the C++ programming language by examining its syntax, the development environment, and tools and techniques to solve some real-world problems. This project was my introduction to C++ and required me to make a class roster displayed through the command line.
